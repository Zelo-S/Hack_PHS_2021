        <h4>What is HackPHS?</h4>
        <p>HackPHS hosts over 300 high school students from across New Jersey to collaborate, 
            innovate, and create in a 24-hour, student organized hackathon based at Princeton 
            High School. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced hacker, HackPHS 
            will have something for you!
        </p>
        <h4>Who pays for all this?</h4>
        <p>HackPHS is completely free to everyone, thanks to our amazing sponsors!</p>
        <h4>What is a hackathon?</h4>
        <p>Hackathons are where creative and enthusiastic people come together to build awesome 
            projects in a single all-nighter. With awesome workshops and incredible prizes, 
            hackers will learn about new tech, build innovative solutions to real-world problems, 
            and share their creation with the community, all in one event. If you are looking for a 
            competition, a place to meet fellow hackers, or even just a place to learn how to code, 
            hackathons are for you.
